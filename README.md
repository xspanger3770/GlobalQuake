## Introduction

GlobalQuake is an experimental Java application that can be used to monitor earthquakes world-wide in near real time.

It enables selection of seismic stations downloaded from publicly available seismic networks via `fdsnws services` supllied by real time data from publicly available `seedlink servers`.\
The program uses this data to detect earthquakes and visualize them on an interactive 3D globe.\
It can also, estimate the earthquake magnitude using various numerical estimation methods, ~~but at the moment it can only work for small and medium size earthquakes, up to magnitude 5 or 6.~~
that are capable of estimating the magnitude reasonably accurately for nearly any earthquake size (most accurate up to M8 though)

> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> Please keep in mind that GlobalQuake is still very experimental and should only be used for entertainment purposes, as the displayed information can be inaccurate or completly wrong.\
> \
> Please be also aware that playing some of the included alarm sounds in public areas can be considered in some countries a form of fearmongering and illegal.

> [!NOTE]<br>
> GlobalQuake doesn't own any form of data, and the respective owners can stop sharing them via Seedlink Server and/or FDSNWS at any moment without notice.

### What GlobalQuake is good at?

* It can easily select publicly available seismic stations.
* It can visualise detected earthquakes on a 3D global interactive map.
* It can quickly estimate small and moderate earthquake's magnitude, location and depth.

### What GlobalQuake is struggling with?

* Larger earthquakes (M6+) often trigger false detections or show duplicated earthquakes.
* Unable to detect multiple earthquakes in the same epicenter in short period of time.
* Calculation of distant earthquakes from a certain set of station is always less accurate than a local earthquake.

## System Requirements

- The system requirements will scale by the number of stations you select. This includes RAM, CPU and network usage.
- You can run GlobalQuake on slower system only to monitor earthquakes in your local area, or if your system can handle it, select hundreds or even thousands of stations around the world.
- Roughly speaking, ~~4GB of RAM~~, 6 CPU cores and 5Mbit network connection should be enough to handle about 1000 stations.
- Update: beginning from version 0.11.0, only around 2GB of RAM is required for running 5000 stations.
- If GlobalQuake starts lagging heavily or even crashes after a few minutes, it is probably due to insufficient RAM in your system, and you need to select fewer stations.
