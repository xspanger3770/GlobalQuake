/**
 * This class implements the JettyWebSocketCreator interface and is responsible for creating WebSocket instances for IP connections with limited connections.
 * It checks the number of connections from a specific IP address and returns a WebSocket instance if the number of connections is below the maximum limit.
 * If the number of connections exceeds the maximum limit, it logs a message and does not create a WebSocket instance.
 * A WebSocket not being returned will cause the connection to be closed.
